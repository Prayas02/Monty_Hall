# Monty_Hall
 Here I have tried to give a simple solution to the famous Monty Hall Problem

 Monty Hall asks you to choose one of three doors. One of the doors hides a prize and the other two doors have no prize(a goat). You state out loud which door you pick, but you don’t open it right away.Monty opens one of the other two doors, and there is no prize behind it.At this moment, there are two closed doors, one of which you picked.The prize is behind one of the closed doors, but you don’t know which one.Time to shatter this illusion with the truth! If you switch doors, you double your probability of winning!(this exact thing is shown by the code)
